### Some words about me
As a working experience I have 3+ years of R coding & data analysis. Working as a project manager I was leading several projects (internal and external), managing a team of 3-5 people. 
As a front-end and web-developer I see my ongoing journey as following: first, get solid programming skills, be able to solve different types of tasks, have experience with small and big projects, including different technologies. Further, learn React to be able to build powerful applications. After getting Middle+/Senior level of experience I want to go into the direction of coaching and Team leading, developing soft skills, improving team work and helping people to become professional using coaching in programming. 

# Code example

```

function disemvowel(str) {
    let vowel = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
    let ArrayOfStr = str.split('')
    let filteredArray = ArrayOfStr.filter(letter => {
        return !vowel.includes(letter.toLowerCase())
    })

    str = filteredArray.join('')
    return str;
}

```
